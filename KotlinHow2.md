# How I created my first Kotlin project

This is not a tutorial, its just a list of questions I came across and how it can be done. 
That is not necessarily how it should be done!

## How do I build?

Kotlin can be built by a Gradle project. The plugin `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin` did the trick.
It seems compatible enough with the application plugin. Remaining Question: Can the plugins-block be used?

## Hellow world 

See class FirstStep.

## Where to find the language definition

https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/ might do.


## How do I get IDE support?

TODO (Internet says Eclipse would do)

## How do Kotlin classes integrate into Java Projects?
